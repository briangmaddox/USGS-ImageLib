   This is a C++ Image library.  The purpose of this library is to
abstract the low level interfaces of each different image format by
providing a common interface to image data.  Some classes also have
functions to return metadata specific to that format (such as the
GeoTIFF zone information).

   This library depends on several other libraries already existing on
your system.  These are the libraries which actually deal with the low
level interface to the formats.  Each of these is also out in the
public domain.  They are libjpeg 6b, libtiff, libgif, libpng,
libgeotiff, and libz.  You should have each of these installed before
attempting to compile this software.
